# Crypto Tracker App

A Crypto Tracker App inspired by SpiralDev's [**CryptoTracker**](https://github.com/SpiralDevelopment/CryptoTracker), built using React Native, utilizing [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3) [~~CoinMarketCap API~~](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#tag/exchange) to track the price of cryptocurrencies.


## User Stories
